# Two-O-Player-Math-Game

### Description
Two-O-Player-Math-Game is an OOP-based Ruby application. Players take turns to answer randomly generated math problems, and must answer correctly or lose a life.

### Rules
1. Both players start with 3 lives.
2. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question.
3. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.
4. The game doesnâ€™t end until one of the players loses all their lives.
